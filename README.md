- 👋 Hi, I’m @peterjohncurtis
- 👀 I’m interested in why the chicken crossed the road when he/her/they clearly hadn't read or been taught to read the highway code.  it was never going to end well.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make a drum go round with motors and pulleys
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on the next big dance hit with 'fred again' so I can retire to the Bahamas
- 📫 How to reach me - if you don't know, I probably want to keep it that way.
